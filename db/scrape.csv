"“By the end of 02035, there will be","The success of the partnership between NASA and SpaceX during 02015-02020 suggests that NASA's Artemis 3 mission will have accomplished its goals by 02030. I am optimistic that progress towards human spaceflight to Mars will accelerate towards the end of the 02020s, and that this will be achieved by the end of 02035."

“The market capitalization of Berkshire Hathaway will be,"As of December 21, 2020, Tesla is set to join the S&P 500 with a market capitalization of over $650 billion. Such a valuation implies the ability to deliver earnings that seem at odds with reality. Tesla has barely begun to show a profit and must earn billions soon (or many billions later) if it is to come close to justifying that valuation. 

Berkshire Hathaway, by contrast, has a market cap of approximately $525 billion and earns about $25 billion after-tax. It also has over $125 billion in excess cash that can be put to profitable use.

Benjamin Graham said that in the short run the market is a voting machine and in the long run it is a weighing machine. I believe it more probable that the market will correctly reappraise Tesla's market cap down to a more reasonable level over the next nine and a half years. 

Tesla is an amazing company whose success I am rooting for as a citizen. Elon Musk is pushing our civilization in a direction it needs to go, and making science/engineering fun for the next generation. However, enthusiasm for the future of electric vehicles and related products should not be translated into unbounded enthusiasm for the valuation of a company. Shareholders of Tesla at current valuations could be in for a shock."
"“By 2050, the United States will have passed","Specifics of the bet: by 2050 there will be a page on Wikipedia (or 2050's version of Wikipedia) similar to this page ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_epidemic_in_the_United_States"" which documents the future medical catastrophe that cost the lives of over 5 million Americans OR at some point before that time copyright and patent laws will be abolished in the United States.

Between 2000 and 2020, 500,000 Americans died in the Opioid crisis. The root cause of the crisis remains ignored, and as a result America remains vulnerable for a repeat. We will see similar events in the future, including at least one 10x+ worse, due to advances in biotech production and distribution technology. We will see more than 5 million Americans lose their lives in the next medical disaster, unless patent and copyright laws are abolished.

The consensus of the media and Justice Department is that the Opioid Crisis began in 1996 when Purdue Pharmaceuticals launched OxyContin. However, the root cause goes one step further, to the US Patent and Trademark Office. Without the U.S. Government 1) granting Purdue a patent on OxyContin giving it the exclusive right to sell the formulation at any price 2) copyright laws protecting Purdue from true and damaging information about the dangers of the medication from leaking and spreading, the opioid crisis would never have happened. Patents were the essential ingredient to Purdue's scheme, as evidenced by a 1996 email from the owner of Purdue urging his executives to ""get an audience for our patent infringement suits so that we are feared as a tiger with claws, teeth and balls, and build some excitement with prescribers that OxyContin Tablets is the way to go.""

The problem is suboptimal, perverse incentives created by patent and copyright laws. A new medical breakthrough without patent protection will generate roughly no more profits for an inventor than having a successful restaurant. A mediocre medical invention with patent protection and misleading marketing will generate profits that make drug lords envious. No reform is possible, patents are rotten at the very core. Couple that with copyright laws, which drastically limit the free flow of information, and you have a recipe for disaster.

If Purdue was bad, things will soon get worse. Exponential improvements in biotechnology and supply chains mean the next Opioid Crisis could happen in 2 years, and not take 20. With the incentives the way they are, the next time someone comes up with a patented medical invention that can be mis-marketed, it will be done so faster. By the time the truth comes out it again will be too late. Next time we'll see more than 5 million Americans die.

Although the damage from copyright and patent laws extends far beyond the Opioid Crisis, and the 500,000 lives lost to that are but a fraction of what these laws have caused us, the Opiod Crisis is a salient and discernible event caused by these laws, and a warning shot that the worst is yet to come if the root cause is not addressed."
“De Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave theory will overtake the Copenhagen,The existence of physical waves seems obviously correct when compared to the alternative of the wave function being a representation of all the possible quantum states of a particle.  Objections to De Broglie-Bohm appear overly emotional to a layman such as myself.
"“At the end of 2030, there will be","Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) industry has a global market over $100 billion, and they are currently manufactured and delivered in protein format. The recent success of mRNA covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna highlights the rapid growth of mRNA technology. mRNA that encodes mAb of interest will emerge as an attractive alternative to replace protein-based mAbs, offering a new kind of safer and cheaper molecular therapeutics. At the end of 2030, there will be at least one mRNA-based mAb that has been approved by a government regulation body, and there will be more mRNA-based mAbs in clinical trials than those of protein-based mAbs."
“No Republican will be President of the USA,"- The Republican Party has collapsed, has no plan to put itself back together again, and has become a minority party representing mostly rural voters.
- No Republican has won the popular vote for President in the 21st century.
- Democrats will pass a raft of laws, from expanding the vote to a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, that will give them a near permanent advantage.
- The demographic shift that Democrats have been talking about for 30+ years is finally happening in a way that will prove decisive.
- Generation Z voters and Millennials are far more progressive because of their life histories (9/11, GFC, Covid) in a way that will not be changed by growing older."
