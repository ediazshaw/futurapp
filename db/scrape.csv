“The market capitalization of Berkshire Hathaway will be,"As of December 21, 2020, Tesla is set to join the S&P 500 with a market capitalization of over $650 billion. Such a valuation implies the ability to deliver earnings that seem at odds with reality. Tesla has barely begun to show a profit and must earn billions soon (or many billions later) if it is to come close to justifying that valuation. 

Berkshire Hathaway, by contrast, has a market cap of approximately $525 billion and earns about $25 billion after-tax. It also has over $125 billion in excess cash that can be put to profitable use.

Benjamin Graham said that in the short run the market is a voting machine and in the long run it is a weighing machine. I believe it more probable that the market will correctly reappraise Tesla's market cap down to a more reasonable level over the next nine and a half years. 

Tesla is an amazing company whose success I am rooting for as a citizen. Elon Musk is pushing our civilization in a direction it needs to go, and making science/engineering fun for the next generation. However, enthusiasm for the future of electric vehicles and related products should not be translated into unbounded enthusiasm for the valuation of a company. Shareholders of Tesla at current valuations could be in for a shock."
"“By 2050, the United States will have passed","Specifics of the bet: by 2050 there will be a page on Wikipedia (or 2050's version of Wikipedia) similar to this page ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_epidemic_in_the_United_States"" which documents the future medical catastrophe that cost the lives of over 5 million Americans OR at some point before that time copyright and patent laws will be abolished in the United States.

Between 2000 and 2020, 500,000 Americans died in the Opioid crisis. The root cause of the crisis remains ignored, and as a result America remains vulnerable for a repeat. We will see similar events in the future, including at least one 10x+ worse, due to advances in biotech production and distribution technology. We will see more than 5 million Americans lose their lives in the next medical disaster, unless patent and copyright laws are abolished.

The consensus of the media and Justice Department is that the Opioid Crisis began in 1996 when Purdue Pharmaceuticals launched OxyContin. However, the root cause goes one step further, to the US Patent and Trademark Office. Without the U.S. Government 1) granting Purdue a patent on OxyContin giving it the exclusive right to sell the formulation at any price 2) copyright laws protecting Purdue from true and damaging information about the dangers of the medication from leaking and spreading, the opioid crisis would never have happened. Patents were the essential ingredient to Purdue's scheme, as evidenced by a 1996 email from the owner of Purdue urging his executives to ""get an audience for our patent infringement suits so that we are feared as a tiger with claws, teeth and balls, and build some excitement with prescribers that OxyContin Tablets is the way to go.""

The problem is suboptimal, perverse incentives created by patent and copyright laws. A new medical breakthrough without patent protection will generate roughly no more profits for an inventor than having a successful restaurant. A mediocre medical invention with patent protection and misleading marketing will generate profits that make drug lords envious. No reform is possible, patents are rotten at the very core. Couple that with copyright laws, which drastically limit the free flow of information, and you have a recipe for disaster.

If Purdue was bad, things will soon get worse. Exponential improvements in biotechnology and supply chains mean the next Opioid Crisis could happen in 2 years, and not take 20. With the incentives the way they are, the next time someone comes up with a patented medical invention that can be mis-marketed, it will be done so faster. By the time the truth comes out it again will be too late. Next time we'll see more than 5 million Americans die.

Although the damage from copyright and patent laws extends far beyond the Opioid Crisis, and the 500,000 lives lost to that are but a fraction of what these laws have caused us, the Opiod Crisis is a salient and discernible event caused by these laws, and a warning shot that the worst is yet to come if the root cause is not addressed."

“Quantum computing & quantum networks will allow us,"Detecting a wave-function of a particle shows it ""spike"", that is it shows us OUR version of the superposition of that particle, but can be calculated mathematically to show all combinations/outcomes. 

Developing a system/machine operating on these particles, we could connect to a similar device in a parallel world - opening a bridge of communication. 

As time goes on, other ""timelines"" start having the same idea, essentially creating a network of probability-based devices. 

A lot of these will be so similar that we just get echoes of the same messages back. We combine the similar ones into a single entity, filtering out the similarities. 

I think we will eventually program a device connected to branching realities, connected via quantum entanglement. All these branches eventually manage to connect to one-another, forming a net of nets, comparing differences and similarities - cultures and scientific advancements. 

This will only include realities where technology has advanced far enough to connect to this net, a large part of the realities will never connect to it, due to natural catastrophe, civilisation collapse, etc."
"“By 1 March 2023, a territorial coup will","In modern Nigeria, where disparity of opportunity between the Northern and Southern region is rife, separatist sentiments have grown throughout the country, with many Yoruba people (indigenous people of South-West Nigeria) have considering development of their economy away from the rest of Nigeria. 

As of early 2021, ‘killer herdsmen’ have began infiltrating Southern regions of Nigeria, killing locals and claiming land to rear cattle. The standing President Buhari has not directly spoken out against this danger, and many Northern leaders, including the Governor of the Northern Bauchi State, has endorsed Nigeria as a settlement for Fulani herdsmen. As these Fulani herdsmen are moving South, armed with AK-47s, this suggests that those moving South have institutional support and/or backing as they take lives in the South.

Additionally, it has been stated by Nigerian Islamic scholar and peace negotiator Sheikh Gumi that these killer herdsmen may become infiltrated by Boko Haram, the infamous jihadist terrorist group, as they overwhelm Southern Nigerian land rights through violence. Overall, this surge in killer herdsmen cases in Southern Nigerian regions, the corresponding apathy of Nigerian Government, paired with indications of possible terrorist infiltration, suggests that the ´killer herdsmen’ issue in 2021 is part of a coordinated plan by Northern Nigerian covert militias to overwhelm land ownership rights in the South before the end of Buhari’s time in Nigerian office as President."
“There will be no serious long-term adverse effects,"Vaccination against COVID-19 is on the run around the world. One of the biggest arguments that sparks doubt in evidence-based medicine and the new mRNA technology is that these vaccines haven't been proven to be safe in the long term, therefore mRNA vaccination could be dangerous for society.

With this bet, I want to challenge the anti-vax movement and all other people that spread this argument and sow doubt in society, making them less prone to vaccinate.

The current mRNA vaccines which are in mass vaccination programs and have been proven to be safe and effective in randomized double-blind studies, i.e. the golden standard of evidence-based medicine, are those of Moderna and Pfizer. This bet is applicable only for them at the moment. Any mRNA vaccine with the same results in the future is counted in this bet too.

By serious long-term adverse effects, I mean long-term or lifelong disability and death, caused by any evidence-based mRNA vaccine in the next 5 or more years. Any effect of this sort must be proved by the standards of evidence-based medicine.

Usually, it's considered a good practice to wish good luck to your opponents. But in this situation, I would refrain from doing it!"

“A top Shakespearean editor or scholar will agree,"Over the last few years, a series of publications have revealed extensive evidence that Sir Thomas North wrote a great number of plays, especially from the 1550s to early 1590s, that Shakespeare would later adapt for the public stage. Here is how we know this:  
1) First, Shakespeare frequently adapted old plays: Though not well known to the general public, scholars are well aware that Shakespeare frequently adapted earlier plays. We know this because of all the records and allusions to Shakespearean plays like ""Romeo and Juliet,"" ""Merchant of Venice,"" ""Hamlet"" etc., -- long before Shakespeare could have written them. Internal evidence also confirms certain plays were adapted from earlier versions. Thus, the question is not *whether* Shakespeare frequently relied on source-plays; the only question is ""Who wrote them?""  
2) Thomas North was a playwright: Although North is known today largely as a translator, new found records indicate that North wrote plays first for his law school of Lincoln's Inn and then for decades for Leicester's Men. Unfortunately, plays were very rarely published during this era, and all of Leicester Men's plays are lost.
3) North’s passages appear in nearly every play in the Shakespeare canon: While North wrote his plays, he frequently recalled and then recycled many of the stories, images, ideas, speeches, and characters from both his published and unpublished writings. He almost assuredly did this from memory, paraphrasing a passage or scene he had written about before — and in the process he would repeat the same language he used earlier. And many of these recycled passages still remain in Shakespeare’s adaptations. The result is that literally hundreds of passages in the Shakespeare canon can be traced back to North’s prose texts. These borrowed passages derive from everything North ever wrote and involve nearly every act of every Shakespeare-play — not just the Roman tragedies. And many of the links between the passages cannot be disputed as they include identical lines that appear nowhere else in the currently-searchable history of the English language.
3) North lived the plays: As shown in Michael Blanding’s ""North by Shakespeare,"" the life and writings of North so persistently dovetail with the works later adapted by William Shakespeare that to follow North’s life in detail is to reconstruct the entire history of the Shakespeare canon, play by play and subplot by subplot.
4) Thomas North’s 1555 Travel Journal, documenting his journey to Rome, was used for ""Henry VIII,"" ""Winter's Tale,"" and other plays. The journal is in North's handwriting and none of its entries would be published till centuries later.   
5) Thomas North’s marginal notes, written in 1591-2 into a used copy of his own ""Dial of Princes,"" indicate he used it when revising early 1590s plays. North underscored many of the passages he would then reuse--especially in ""Arden of Feversham"" and ""The Taming of the Shrew""
6) Literary insiders from the era -- including Thomas Nashe, Gabriel Harvey, Henry Chettle, Thomas Lodge, and Ben Jonson -- made extensive references to Thomas North and his original authorship of the plays adapted by Shakespeare. 
7) North reused material from his last translation, ""Nepos Lives,"" which he would not published till 1602, for ""Richard II,""  which was first published in 1597. It is difficult to explain how anyone else but North could have managed to borrow material from his own personal translations of ""Nepos’ Lives,"" five years before North published it.
8) In 1576, George North, a likely cousin of Thomas, wrote an essay on rebellions and rebels while staying at North’s family estates of Kirtling Hall. In 2018, news that this unique, previously unpublished essay, which was always kept at the North-family library, was an important source for the Shakespeare canon made the front page of ""The New York Times"" as well as other major news outlets around the world. 
This and many other facts convince me that even some of those with the most invested in the current view of Shakespeare -- highly-respected Shakespeare scholars and editors--will begin to see the significance of the evidence for North's authorship of Shakespeare's source-plays and start to acknowledge it."
“By 2050 we will have made several breakthroughs,"In the past decades research on aging biology has shown that it is indeed possible to extend health and lifespan in model organisms such as worms, flies, fish and mice. Various methods have been tested, such as small molecule administration of rapamycin, NAD+, metformin and alphaketoglutarate, blood rejuvenation via heterochronic parabiosis, stem cell therapy for tissue regeneration, removal of senescent cells, DNA modifications, etc. just to name a few.

Since the science is already confirmed in the laboratory, clinical trials on humans have already started for some of the above mentioned interventions. In the coming decade more money will flow into the longevity industry, more  research will be conducted, which will result in more progress being made in understanding and manipulating the aging process.

Hence no later than 2030 the first commercial therapies will be approved by the FDA allowing minor improvements in health and lifespan.

At the same time clinical trials for more advanced longevity therapies are going to be started, yielding results by 2040.
The following decade the task will be to commercialise these therapies in a scalable manner and optimise the processes that are involved in manufacturing, such that by 2050 the general population is going to have access to affordable rejuvenation therapies that extend health and lifespan to 120 years."

"“By 2046, a 100MW fusion plant will be","The reason is simple: money. Or capital, if you prefer. Capital gets things done, and now, capital is interested in getting fusion done. Between General Fusion, TAE (formerly Tri-Alpha Energy), Commonwealth, Hellion, and others, there is massive funding moving into commercial fusion. Very likely, most of them will fail to reach unity. But I think it is also likely that at least one of them will succeed. And once one does, capital will do what IT does, and start extracting return on its investment, which means rapidly scaling and deploying.

Commercial fusion is closer than fusion-skeptic academics like to acknowledge. Yes, there have been delays, but the progress is orders of magnitude faster than we have seen at ITER. And everyone knows the NIF is a weapons program, not an energy research. Commercial fusion startups are (ahem) laser-focused on producing a working fusion plant, within a timetable that provides their investors a reasonable return on investment. I think at least one will succeed within the next 25 years."

"“Ten years from now, on September 15th, 2031,","Bitcoin is a societally important phenomenon because it holds the potential to become the world’s single currency, and is as of today already an important asset, worth approximately $1 trillion. Will Bitcoin continue to grow as a phenomenon, or is it merely a fad? Perhaps due to it being the first of its kind, opinions strongly diverge on the matter. For example, risk specialist Nassim Nicholas Taleb published a paper entitled “Bitcoin, Currencies, and Fragility” explaining that Bitcoin must ultimately be worth 0. Others such as economist Nouriel Roubini and billionaire John Paulson share this opinion. However, the path to the price of 0 cannot be predicted, meaning Bitcoin could be worth $100k, $1M, or any other value before ultimately reaching 0 and staying there. Due to this difficulty of “path dependence”, it is not possible to use traditional markets such as the futures market to reasonably bet on Bitcoin’s demise (which has been lamented by Nassim Nicholas Taleb and John Paulson). What is needed instead is a bet with a long expiration date which is independent of the price behavior until that expiration date.

I am hereby predicting that Bitcoin will not disappear, and that it will still have value 10 years from now, on September 15th, 2031. The world needs an asset with money-like properties and a capped supply. Bitcoin’s price increase until now, its user adoption, and technological progress are all testament to the fact that this need is recognized and that Bitcoin is being adopted more and more. Bitcoin enjoys network effects, meaning that the more users it has, the more users it will attract. By virtue of being the cyptocurrency or cryptoasset with the highest market cap and the most brand recognition, Bitcoin enjoys the strongest network effects among possible competitors. This makes Bitcoin ever less likely to be just a fad and disappear. I am therefore predicting that prophecies of Bitcoin’s demise within a reasonable time frame will be proven wrong.

I am predicting that Bitcoin will have at least a small purchasing power instead of predicting that it will have a non-zero purchasing power because I want to increase the odds of my prediction being challenged. One could argue that a number of cryptocurrencies are stubbornly in a state that is neither quite dead nor alive, with a value of close to 0, but not quite. It is easy to give a token an arbitrarily small value, hence my counter-side might be understandably reluctant to accept a bet predicting a value of precisely 0.

I am using gold as a measure of value instead of a major currency for two reasons:
1. Over the ten year period of my prediction, the currency might lose a lot of value due to inflation (an event of hyperinflation cannot be ruled out), making difficult the inflation adjustment calculation. 
2. Bitcoin is frequently compared to gold. Nassim Nicholas Taleb claims that Bitcoin has an inherent “absorbing barrier”, which gold lacks, supposedly making Bitcoin very fragile. John Paulson also compares the two but recommends buying gold and predicts the demise of Bitcoin. 
Gold is therefore the natural measuring rod for Bitcoin. A price of 0.05 troy ounces of gold per Bitcoin is equivalent to a bit more than 80 USD per Bitcoin (today’s price and dollars), a price Bitcoin has managed to achieve only in its fifth year of existence (2013), thereby clearly being a price that can be considered “non negligible”. The price of Bitcoin in terms of troy ounces of gold can currently be tracked at the following URL https://www.investing.com/crypto/bitcoin/btc-xau under the ticker “BTCXAU”."

2. They are, increasingly, responsible for a rising number of conjunctions. Some estimates have 2 COLA maneuvers a day by 2034.

3. Other players in the trade space will increase the likelihood of collisions by creating debris that will fall into Starlink's planned orbits.
